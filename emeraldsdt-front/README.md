# üöÄ Emeralds DT

A full-stack web application built with a modern and efficient stack: React, Vite, Node.js, and styled entirely with Tailwind CSS. This project is designed for rapid development, performance, and scalability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Fast & Modern Frontend: Utilizes React with Vite for lightning-fast module bundling and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

Responsive UI: Styled using Tailwind CSS utility-first framework for a fully responsive and clean design.

Robust Backend: Powered by Node.js and Express (or similar framework) to handle API requests and business logic.

[Feature 4]: Example: User authentication using JWTs.

[Feature 5]: Example: Real-time data synchronization.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is divided into two main components: client (Frontend) and server (Backend).

Component

Technology

Description

Frontend

React

User interface library.

### Vite

Build tool and development server for fast development.

### Tailwind CSS

Utility-first CSS framework for styling.



### JavaScript (ESM)

Primary language for the client-side logic.

Backend

Node.js

Server-side runtime environment.



Express.js

Web application framework (or similar, e.g., Koa).



[Database]

E.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

npm (or yarn/pnpm)

Git

üíª Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name


2. Backend Setup (Server)

Navigate to the server directory, install dependencies, and set up your environment variables.

cd server
npm install


Configuration:

Create a file named .env in the server directory and add your configuration variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, port number):

PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string_here"
JWT_SECRET="super_secret_key"


3. Frontend Setup (Client)

Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies.

cd ../client
npm install


Configuration:

If your frontend needs environment variables (e.g., the API URL), create a file named .env in the client directory. Vite requires prefixing environment variables with VITE_.

VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"


üèÉ Running the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

1. Start the Backend API

From the server directory:

npm start
# The server will run at http://localhost:3000 (or your configured PORT)


2. Start the Frontend Development Server

From the client directory:

npm run dev
# The client app will be accessible at http://localhost:5173


The application is now running and ready for development!

üì¶ Deployment

Frontend (Client)

To create a production build of the React app:

cd client
npm run build
