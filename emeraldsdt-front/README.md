💻 Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies.

cd ../client
npm install

Configuration:

If your frontend needs environment variables (e.g., the API URL), create a file named .env in the client directory. Vite requires prefixing environment variables with VITE_.

VITE_API_BASE_URL="<http://localhost:3000/api>"

🏃 Running the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

2. Start the Frontend Development Server

From the client directory:

npm run dev

# The client app will be accessible at <http://localhost:5173>

The application is now running and ready for development!

📦 Deployment

Frontend (Client)

To create a production build of the React app:

cd client
npm run build
